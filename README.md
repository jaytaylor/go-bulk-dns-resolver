Go Bulk DNS Resolver
====================

About
-----
Lightning-fast high-performance bulk DNS resolution tool written in [Go](http://golang.org/) based on [miekg/dns](https://github.com/miekg/dns).

Requirements
------------

* Unbound caching DNS resolver + development libraries 

    - OSX: `brew update && brew install unbound`

    - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unbound libunbound-dev

Building
--------
    ./build.sh

Examples
--------
The input is a newline-delimited list of domain names or URLs.  The output will be of the form `<domain> <ip1> <ip2> .. <ipN>`.

Lookups (hostname -> IP):

    echo 'google.com' | ./bulkdns
	google.com 74.125.239.34 74.125.239.46 74.125.239.38 74.125.239.33 74.125.239.36 74.125.239.35 74.125.239.40 74.125.239.39 74.125.239.32 74.125.239.37 74.125.239.41

Reverse lookups (IP -> hostname):
    echo 216.58.194.206 | ./bulkdns
        216.58.194.206 sfo03s01-in-f14.1e100.net.

Options
-------
`-p` will keep the output prefix exactly like the input prefix.  By default, the behavior is to prefix the output with only the domain name.
